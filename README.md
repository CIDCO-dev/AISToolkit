# AIS Tool Kit 
## What is AIS tool kit   

Ais tool kit is a project developped by CIDCO in Rimouski to be able to collect data (NMEA messages) from boats navigating on the Saint-Lawrence River using a Raspberry Pi and an antenna we builded ourselves. The first part of this README will be devoted to the software implementation an the second part to the [instructions](https://github.com/Jacobb13/AISToolkit/blob/main/Hardware/README.md) on how to build the antenna.  

## Software implementation 
1. Formate your Raspberry Pi 3 with Ubuntu Server 64-bits 20.04.4 LTS operating system using "Raspberry Pi Imager".  
2. clone the github repository : git clone https://github.com/CIDCO-dev/AISToolKit
3. launch the installation script : ./install ais
