# AIS Tool Kit 
## What is AIS tool kit   

Ais tool kit is a project developped by CIDCO in Rimouski to be able to collect data (NMEA messages) from boats navigating on the St Lawrence River using a Raspberry Pi and an antenna we builded ourselves. The first part of this README will be devoted to the software implementation an the second part to the [instructions](https://github.com/Jacobb13/AISToolkit/blob/main/Hardware/README.md) on how to build the antenna.  

## Software implementation 
### Installing ais catcher on a Raspberry Pi 3
1. Format a SD card and install on it Ubuntu Server 64-bits 20.04.4 LTS using "Raspberry Pi Imager".  
2. Clone the github repository : git clone https://github.com/CIDCO-dev/AISToolKit
3. Launch the installation script : ./install_ais_catcher

### Installing ais dispatcher on a server (or a VM)
1. Clone the github repository : git clone https://github.com/CIDCO-dev/AISToolKit
2. ./install_ais_dispatcher





###  Building the antenna  

Here are the [instructions](https://github.com/Jacobb13/AISToolkit/blob/main/Hardware/README.md) to build your own antenna !
